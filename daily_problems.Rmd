Compute the running median of a sequence of numbers. That is, given a stream of numbers, print out the median of the list so far on each new element.

Recall that the median of an even-numbered list is the average of the two middle numbers.

For example, given the sequence [2, 1, 5, 7, 2, 0, 5], your algorithm should print out:

2
1.5
2
3.5
2
2
2

```{r}
seq <- c(5,3,2,4,5,2)
len <- length(seq)
new_list <- list()
for (x in 1:len){
  new_list = append(new_list, seq[x]) 
  i <- unlist(new_list)
  med <-median(i)
  print(med)
}
```
Example given in question:
```{r}
seq <- c(2, 1, 5, 7, 2, 0, 5)
len <- length(seq)
new_list <- list()
for (x in 1:len){
  new_list = append(new_list, seq[x]) 
  i <- unlist(new_list)
  med <-median(i)
  print(med)
}
```
